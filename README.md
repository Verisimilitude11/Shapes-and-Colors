# Colors
* A tuple is surrounded by ( ) with values separated by commas
* White: (255, 255, 255) and black: (0, 0, 0)
* Colors are: the amount of red in the color, amount of green in the color, amount of blue in the color
* These are the "primary colors" of light (different than paint/pigment)
* All three values must be between 0 and 255
* All three values must be ints
* The higher the numbers, the more light (closer to white)
* The lower the numbers, the less light (closer to black)
